# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023 â€” Data Analysis & Visualization

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, consisting of over 18,000 developer responses worldwide. The objective was to extract meaningful insights from the raw survey data and communicate them effectively through visual analytics.

Using Python for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and Google Looker Studio for dashboard visualization, this project demonstrates a complete data workflow â€” from raw data to decision-ready insights.
